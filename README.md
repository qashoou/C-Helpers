# Cpp-Helpers
A small std based helper class to use while working on small projects.

Its a collection of small helper functions used in daily C++. I use them in almost every C++ project i have. So, i need them often and I copy from different places. 

To avoid finding them from different places, i have decided to put them all together for me and anyone who needs them

They are intended to be cross-platform with stdC++11 and onwards.

Happy C++
